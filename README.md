> An all in one theme for your home on the internet

I wanted to make a custom theme for my website and drew inspiration from
[Ru Singhs](https://rusingh.com/) website ([old one](https://old.rusingh.com/)). I liked the idea of
having the homepage, blog and list of projects or other stuff I want to share in one place. This is
still a work in progress and there are some more things I want to do (custom rss feed template,
good seo support, latex support...).

## Demo

Nothing to see here, move along.

## Features

Here is a list of some useful features that I wanted to have:

* Minimal design
* Dark and light theme (set automatically)
* Responsive design
* Thumbnails for blog posts
* Homepage + other sections (blog, projects, about)

## Installation

Beacuse this theme is made using TailwindCSS and there are some class names that are generated based
on the website config, I won't compile the theme. To use it, you'll need to install Node.js
dependecies when building the website. If you're using a CI service like GitHub actions or GitLab
CI, just install the dependencies for the theme (`npm ci`) before building the site.
